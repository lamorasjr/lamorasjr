## Hello, I am Luiz! ðŸ‘‹

I am data enthusiastic. I like to study and develop data related projects, mainly about data engineering and visualization.

- ðŸ«¶ A Few Things I Love
  - Building Projects - Whether itâ€™s a fun weekend project or a serious business initiative, Iâ€™m constantly experimenting and improving my skills with hands-on data projects. From small-scale analytics to complex data engineering challenges, I love creating things that make data easier to work with.

  - Learning - The world of data is ever-evolving, and I thrive on staying up to date with the latest technologies, frameworks, and techniques. Iâ€™m constantly learning and exploring new tools in data engineering, AI, and visualization.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on to improve my tech stack in data engineering by learning and developing projects with dbt, aiwflow, sql and python.

- ðŸš€ Letâ€™s Connect! 
I'm always open to collaborating with like-minded professionals who share a passion for data. If youâ€™d like to discuss a project, share ideas, or just talk about the latest in data trends, feel free to get in touch!
